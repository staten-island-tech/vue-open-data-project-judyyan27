Add Chart.js

Installation
You can install vue-chartjs over yarn or npm or pnpm. However, you also need to add chart.js as a dependency to your project because Chart.js is a peerDependency. This way you can have full control over the versioning of Chart.js.

pnpm add vue-chartjs chart.js

# or

yarn add vue-chartjs chart.js

# or

npm i vue-chartjs chart.js
